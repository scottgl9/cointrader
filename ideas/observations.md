## Notes on my general observations about market behavior

### Notes on RSI/Volume
"Big gainers" tend to do the following:
- If there is a massive volume spike when RSI crosses up over 70, price will uptrend rapidly
"Big losers" tend to do the following:
- if there is a massive volume spike when RSI crosses down over 30, price will downtrend rapidly
NOTE: These big movers tend to have very low relative volume before the volume spike
